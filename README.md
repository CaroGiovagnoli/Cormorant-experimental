###Cormorant typeface

Cormorant is a free type family developed by Christian Thalmann ([Catharsis Fonts](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Catharsis_Fonts/)).  For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit [its Bēhance page](https://www.behance.net/gallery/28579883/Cormorant-an-open-source-display-font-family).

Cormorant is open source, and all its working files (in Glyphs format) are available from this repository. If you wish to work with Cormorant in a different font editor (which I wouldn't recommend), I can provide you with UFO versions of those files instead.

Any feedback, bug reports, test results, and suggestions for additions are very welcome.  You can contact me under `christian dot d dot thalmann at gmail dot com` or ping me on Twitter under `@CatharsisFonts`.  

###Installation

**If you wish to use the Cormorant type family on your computer, simply download [the ZIP file](https://github.com/CatharsisFonts/Cormorant/blob/master/Cormorant_OTF_Font_Family.zip), unpack it, and install the .otf files as appropriate for your operating system.**

**If you wish to use the Cormorant type family on your website, please make use of the Google Fonts webfont directory.  _(This option is not yet available.)_**

###License and Download
 
The Cormorant typeface and all its associated font files are free software under the [SIL Open Font License](https://github.com/CatharsisFonts/Cormorant/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Essentially, this gives you the right to download, use, and redistribute the fonts as you like, provided that

###Acknowledgements
 
Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by myself (Christian Thalmann, [Catharsis Fonts](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Catharsis_Fonts/)). I did all the work with [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/), which I consider the world's best font editing software. It's not free, but it's worth every penny ten times over; I cannot recommend it enough. I used the public beta version of the RMX Harmonizer plug-in to ensure curve quality.
 
While this project was heavily inspired by [Claude Garamont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond)'s immortal legacy, I did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for my designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when I needed guidance on a specific character, I searched [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/) for the term «Garamond» and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
 
I am very grateful to the creative souls on the [TypeDrawers](http://typedrawers.com/) forum and the (late?) [Typophile](http://typophile.com/) forum for teaching me all I know about type design in the first place, and for providing me with a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant in particular. Likewise, my gratitude goes to the tireless folks at [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) — in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer (Mekka Blue, [Schriftlabor](http://schriftlabor.at/)) and Georg Seifert — for the creation and support of their magnificent engine. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for making the Open Source release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.
