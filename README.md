###Acknowledgements
 
Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by myself (Christian Thalmann, [Catharsis Fonts](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Catharsis_Fonts/)). I did all the work with [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/), which I consider the world's best font editing software. It's not free, but it's worth every penny ten times over; I cannot recommend it enough. I used the public beta version of the RMX Harmonizer plug-in to ensure curve quality.
 
While this project was heavily inspired by [Claude Garamont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond)'s immortal legacy, I did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for my designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when I needed guidance on a specific character, I searched [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/) for the term «Garamond» and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
 
I am very grateful to the creative souls on the [TypeDrawers](http://typedrawers.com/) forum and the (late?) [Typophile](http://typophile.com/) forum for teaching me all I know about type design in the first place, and for providing me with a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant in particular. Likewise, my gratitude goes to the tireless folks at [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) — in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer (Mekka Blue, [Schriftlabor](http://schriftlabor.at/)) and Georg Seifert — for the creation and support of their magnificent engine. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for making the Open Source release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.
